# Decibel Meter App

The application is divided into two parts: the **Client** and the **Dashboard**.

## Client

### Gameplay

Players control a spaceship that launches missiles to destroy incoming invaders. Each invader destroyed earns one point. However, avoid colliding with invader ships, as this will end the game.

### Description

Once the game begins, invader ships will randomly appear at the top of the screen and slowly move downward. Meanwhile, stars will quickly move from top to bottom in the background, creating an illusion that the player and invader ships are moving rapidly upward. The stars will also twinkle during this effect.

## Dashboard

### Preparation

In the preparation interface, a large "Ready" button is displayed. Once clicked, it changes to a "Start" button, and players can join the queue, with their names shown below.

### Leaderboard

After clicking the "Start" button, the interface switches to the leaderboard page. Here, player rankings are displayed in real time in a list format. When rankings change, items will animate to show the movement up or down, creating a sense of tension. Each entry on the leaderboard has two sections: on the left, a line graph showing score progression over time, and on the right, the playerâ€™s avatar and current score.

When the game ends, an "Award" button appears.

### Awards

After clicking the "Award" button, an awards page displays the top three players with the highest scores.
